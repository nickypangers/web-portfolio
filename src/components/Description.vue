          My name is Nixon Pang and I'm a Programmer with professional
          experience in creating websites and mobile applications for both
          Android and iOS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently working as a Web/Mobile Application developer at a
          digital agency based in Hong Kong. My day to day tasks include turning
          design wireframes and client's ideas into reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I have the right to work in both Canada and Hong Kong, I'm open
          to relocation on a global level should the opportunity arise.
